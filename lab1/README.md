## Algorithms

We used an advanced greedy algorithm in two different versions:

the first one use the ratio between new number discovered and the lenght of new list to perform the optimal choice;

the second one use the ratio between new number discovered and the interesction between the new list and the covered one, so the repeated number that will be inserted in the solution.


## Performances

Both algorithm have better beformance than Gready algorithm.
The second one perform better with larger N but is more time expensive.
